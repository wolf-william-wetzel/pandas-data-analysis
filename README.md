# Overview

This project is my attempt to learn how to use pandas and matplotlib,
as I have not previously used these modules in my Python experience.

The dataset I am analyzing in this program is a `csv` file of LEGO set data.
The file includes data such as the year the set was released, the number of pieces in the set, and so on.
The dataset was obtained [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rtatman/lego-database?select=sets.csv).

I have always been interested in LEGOs, and since I had no experience with either pandas or matplotlib,
I decided to undertake this project to further my learning in Python.

# Data Analysis Results

I had two questions based on the dataset:
- How has the piece count of LEGO sets changed over time?
- Has the number of sets released every year been increasing, decreasing, stable, or something else?

Answers:
- The average piece count has been increasing.
- The number of sets per year follows an upward trend.

# Development Environment

I used Jetbrains Pycharm Community Edition as my IDE.

I used Python version 3.12.2 as my programming language.

I used the `pandas` package version 2.2.2 for data analysis.

I used the `matplotlib` package version 3.9.0 for data visualization.

# Future Work

* Create fancier matplotlib charts.
* Add more questions and answers from the dateset.
* Make terminal text prettier.
